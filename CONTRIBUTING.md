# Contributing Guidelines

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit just the modifications, do not mess with the composer.json or CHANGELOG.md files.
* Ensure your code is nicely formatted in the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) style and that all tests pass.
* Send the pull request.
* Check that the Travis CI build passed. If not, rinse and repeat.
